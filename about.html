      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I'm based in Sun Valley, ID, where I fell in love with the mountains and discovered my passion for outdoor adventures—skiing, hiking, biking, and more. 
        This environment fosters my belief in maximizing efficiency to have more time for life's true joys—family, nature, and meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I've carved out a niche in commercial real estate, focusing on single-tenant net lease properties nationwide. 
        My work demands precision, strategic thinking, and a commitment to my clients’ best interests. 
        I approach every deal with a long-term perspective, focusing on building relationships and delivering consistent results.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Fatherhood & Growth?</h2>
      <p>
        Being a father is one of my greatest sources of pride and motivation. 
        I strive to pass on core values of honesty, courage, curiosity, and perseverance. 
        Continual personal and professional growth is not just a mantra—it's a lifestyle I embrace and encourage in my family, colleagues, and clients alike.
